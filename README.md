# Reason To Season
Reason To Season is an educational app designed to teach the fundamental concept of seasons, a crucial element influencing numerous life processes on Earth. By simplifying complex ideas such as axial tilt and its impacts, the app aims to make these concepts intuitive and accessible.

## Overall Concept
Understanding seasons is essential yet often misunderstood, even among adults. Our app addresses this by presenting the concepts in an engaging and easy-to-understand manner, ensuring that students grasp the foundational knowledge accurately.

## Target Audience and Stakeholders
The core users of our app as identified by us will be students aged 10-12, as well as their parents and teachers. The app is designed to be highly engaging and visually dynamic, leveraging interactive software capabilities to enhance learning beyond traditional methods.

## Learning Objectives
Our learning objectives are derived from the New Zealand Science Curriculum for levels 4-5 (ages 11-14):

Understand the main factors causing seasonal change and their key features.

Comprehend how axial tilt results in symmetrical seasonal effects across both hemispheres.

Investigate and appreciate the effects of seasonal changes on various natural and human processes.

These objectives help students connect the dots between the solar system's components, common life processes, and planetary conditions, all directly related to seasons and their impacts.

## Features
**Interactive Orbit Page:** Users can drag the Earth around the sun to see seasonal changes.

**Activities:** Structured tasks that teach specific concepts through interactive elements and pop-ups.

**Quizzes and Badges:** Users receive immediate feedback and rewards for their progress, enhancing motivation and engagement.
